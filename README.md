# TheMonarch
  This is a discord bot that deletes people's swears and replies back with an insult. IT sometimes even randomly replies to people with insults. Basically, it's a troll bot.

# Features:-
It deletes messages that contain a swear, and replies back with a randomly generated insult; unless the message is from a moderator or someone who can kick people from the server, in that case, it'll just politely ask the mod to not swear.

  It randomly insults everyone who isn't a moderator.


  It randomly compliments moderators.

  I used https://www.npmjs.com/package/noswearing to detect if a word is a swear or not.

  I got the image for the bot's profile pic from:- https://i.pinimg.com/originals/54/88/ec/5488ec11fa38d85b904cf958f7bdf9c0.jpg
