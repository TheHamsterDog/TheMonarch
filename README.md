# TheMonarch
  This is a discord bot that deletes people's swears and replies back with an insult. IT sometimes even randomly replies to people with insults. Basically, it's a troll bot.
# Update:
  This bot isn't running on a server anymore; however, you can still download this code, add your API keys, and then run it on your own.
# Features:-
It deletes messages that contain a swear, and replies back with a randomly generated insult; unless the message is from a moderator or someone who can kick people from the server, in that case, it'll just politely ask the mod to not swear.

  It randomly insults everyone who isn't a moderator.


  It randomly compliments moderators.
